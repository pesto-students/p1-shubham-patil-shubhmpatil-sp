            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
                the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
                Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
                the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
